description: We study the cognitive architecture of the language production and comprehension systems and their links with other cognitive functions using a variety of methods and measurements: response times, eye-tracking, EEG, corpus data. We have a dedicated interest in applied statistics (machine learning, bayesian models, linear mixed-effects models, etc.) and attach great importance to open science practices.

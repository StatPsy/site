I completed my PhD in cognitive pyschology at RWTH Aachen University (Germany). Since August 2025, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the StatPsy team led by Prof Audrey Bürki. In my research, I conduct behavioural experiments on adults to uncover the cognitive mechanisms responsible for executive functions. Specifically, my research is at the interesection of cognitive control and associative mechanisms, such as feature binding and episodic retrieval. I investigate the control mechanisms enabling humans to flexibly switch between tasks (multitasking), and different languages (bilingual language production). In this setting, I am as well interested in the contribution of binding & retrieval to multitasking performance. More recently, I have extended this line of research to single-task settings, investigating the role of binding and retrieval mechanisms in working memory.

I started on June 2025 in the StatPsy lab and I'm interested in using reaction times and electro-encephalography (EEG) to time mental events underlying decision-making and language comprehension. For that I developed a method that reveals hidden pattern in the EEG ([HMP python package](https://github.com/gweindel/hmp)).
